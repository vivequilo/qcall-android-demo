# QCall Android ðŸ“±
Android library for video calls using QÃ¼ilo S.A servers. 

__Install QCall Android__

With __gradle__   <img src="https://jitpack.io/docs/favicon.ico" width="20"/>
First add the $TOKEN provided to you by Quilo unde your gradle.properties
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/F0p1tJp/Screen-Shot-2020-07-30-at-11-22-03-AM.png" width="100"/>
```gradle
authToken=$TOKEN
```

Second add to the **project module** build.gradle file the following. (add the token as the credential)
```gradle
maven {  
  url 'https://jitpack.io'
  credentials { username authToken }
}
```
Next add the following to the **app module**  build.gradle file the add following
```gradle
//Under andriod braces
compileOptions {  
  sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8  
  targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8  
}  
  
kotlinOptions {  
  jvmTarget = '1.8'  
}
```

In the same **app module**  build.gradle file add the following in dependencies
```gradle
def qcall_version = '0.0.1' 
dependencies {
	implementation "com.github.vivequilo:qcall-android:$qcall_version"
}
```

## Example building a room
```kotlin
/**
* Must ask for permissions in order to record camera
*/
class MainAcitvity : AppCompatActivity {
    private lateinit var room: Room
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
        room = Room
                .Builder(activity, "reploy", "APIKEY", roomId = "1")
                .setMetadata(JsonObject().apply { addProperty("name", "Augusto") })
                .build()
    }
}
```
## Example handle on local stream
```kotlin
/**
* Must ask for permissions in order to record camera
*/
override fun onLocalStream(localPeerId: String, localStream: MediaStream) {  
    super.onLocalStream(localPeerId, localStream)  
	val local_view = findViewById<QVideoRenderer>(R.id.local_view)
    localStream.videoTracks.firstOrNull()?.let {  
		local_view.setVideoTrack(it)  
    }  
}
```
## Required permissions
Required permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />  
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />  
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>  
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />  
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
```

## Mount Service
In the AndroidManifest.xml add under the application tag the following.
```xml
<service android:name="com.vivequilo.qcall_lib.peerKt.services.RoomService"/>
```
